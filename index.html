            <h1>All about me.</h1>
    <p>     Hello! My name is James! Like most people, I am many things! A father, husband, Army veteran, previous business owner but forever- someone who loves to experience things. <br>
     I love reading, mostly fantasy, but on occasion sci-fi finds a way to dig into my mind. Robert A Heinlein springs to mind, especially "Starship Troopers" and <br>
     "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress". Though a more modern favorite of mine would be, "Children of Time" by Adrian Tchaikovsky, which I highly reccomend. <br>
     For fun I try to make a habit of going to the gym, which I do enjoy at least half the time. But I definetley prefer more time getting lost in video games that <br>
     either give me the freedom to create my own narrative, apply a subtle touch of narrative that complements gameplay, or an asymmetrical/social multiplayer game. <br>
     I'm big into social science and psychology so I love the concept of players having different win states and rules. <br> </p>
